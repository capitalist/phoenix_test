## 0.4.0

### Breaking

- Select options were previously matched inexactly (as a substring match). That
  made it impossible to differentiate between two options where one was a subset
  of the other.

  For example, using `select(session, "Email", from: "Contact")` could not
  differentiate between the `Email` and `Email and SMS` options. Select options
  are now matched exactly. Commits [dc7ba01] and [e675561].

  This is a technically a bug fix, but it's also a potentially breaking change
  for existing tests that accidentally relied on that behavior. If you need
  inexact matches on options, please open an issue describing your use case.
